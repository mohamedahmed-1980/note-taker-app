# note-taker-app

I Created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## User Story

The user is able to write and save notes
The able to delete noteshe has written before
The user can organize his thoughts and keep track of tasks he need to complete

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

App is deployed to Heroku here:
